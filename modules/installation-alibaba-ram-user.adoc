= Creating a RAM user

.Questions

. When configuring the access mode, is `API Call-based Access` a required access mode?

. While we have a list of permissions for the cloud account, is there a specific out-of-the-box policy that can be assigned to the RAM user or must a policy be created?

Before you install {product-title}, create a Resource Access Manager (RAM) user.

When you configure the RAM user, be sure to complete the following steps:

.Procedure

. Select the `API Call-based Access` access mode.

. Record the access key ID and secret access key values. You must use these
values when you configure your local machine to run the installation program.

. Attach the `xyz` policy to ensure that the account has
sufficient permission to create the cluster. This policy provides the cluster
with the ability to grant credentials to each {product-title} component. The
cluster grants the components only the credentials that they require.

[NOTE]
====
While it is possible to create a policy that grants all of the required
permissions and attach it to the user, this is not the preferred option.
The cluster will not have the ability to grant additional credentials to
individual components, so the same credentials are used by all components.

= Configuring DNS

To install {product-title}, the Alibaba Cloud account you use must
have a dedicated public hosted zone in your account. This zone must be
authoritative for the domain. This service provides
cluster DNS resolution and name lookup for external connections to the cluster.

.Procedure

. Identify your domain, or subdomain, and registrar. You can transfer an existing domain and
registrar or obtain a new one through Alibaba or another source.

[NOTE]
====
If you purchase a new domain through Alibaba Cloud, it takes time for the relevant DNS
changes to propagate. For more information about purchasing domains through AWS, see link:https:/www.alibabacloud.com/domain[Alibaba Cloud domains].
====

. If you are using an existing domain and registrar, migrate its DNS to Alibaba Cloud. See
link:https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/42479.htm[Domain name transfer]
in the Alibaba Cloud documentation.

. Configure DNS for your domain. This includes:
* Creating a public hosted zone for your domain or subdomain.
* Extracting the new authoritative name servers from the hosted zone records.
* Updating the registrar records for the name servers that your domain uses.

+
Use an appropriate root domain, such as `openshiftcorp.com`, or subdomain,
such as `clusters.openshiftcorp.com`.

. If you are using a subdomain, follow the procedures of your company to add its delegation records to the parent domain.

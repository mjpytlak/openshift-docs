.Questions
. The CCO must be put into manual mode before installing the cluster, correct?
. While "Manually create IAM" is a generic procedure on how to put the CCO into manual mode, who can provide the Alibaba-specific info for step 5. For context, I have included the AWS-specific content.

In environments where the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not reachable, you must put the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) into manual mode before you install the cluster.
